## This application presents for users a way of uniquely annotating a locally stored collection of images.

A key feature is that emotions are stored by the user's explicit input over a set of values for a set of different emotions. This is in contrast to many models where emoticons represent a small set of specific emotions a user must choose from rather than _tune_

### <span style="color:red">let's drop the '**U**' from '**U-RL**' because why do we need a UNI-verse and the UNI-queness it imposes?.. let's break free of that and "Tag the Planet!" </span>

For the development phase, this principle must be put in top priority
1. The data the users hold is **key**. The tool must smoothly incentivize the users to want to describe content with tags
