# Tagasaurus, your gateway to the semantic multiverse "Tag the Planet!" 

### First step to have the tool allow a user to insert content and tag it as it enters the folder storage place




---

For the development phase, these principles must be put in top priority
1. The data the users hold is **key**. The tool must smoothly incentivize the users to want to describe content with tags
2. How the users tag content should not be altered. There may be recommendations such as using nested semantic variables and especially **triple store**, but if the user wants to tag in their way let it be so, and it is the 'system' that filters out the redundant or not worthy content pieces and their tags.
3. The Network effect should be exploited as much as possible and **preferential attachment** and the feedback to users for growing the network in this way needs to be rewarded
4. Redundancy is **natural** and is allowable and dealt with different network views
5. Local network universes are better than global clutter views from top down no matter how well and algorithm can direct a path
