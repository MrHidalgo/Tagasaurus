The quote from Kalashnikov (the famous gun designer) should be taken
seriously: "Things that are complex are not useful, Things that are
useful are simple."*

- What do we want to do? Solve problems.

- What problem have we identified? Adding suitable meta-data (like
  tags) to resources/content/media/files is cumbersome and time
  consuming.

- What are we going to do about it? Give users a tool to tag resources
  as they naturally desire and provide a sharing mechanism that
  captures the correspondance and compatibility of the resourses and
  meta-data.

- How will that work? Meta-data is applied to content by users which
  is then shared, users receiving new content and the associated
  meta-data sample the compatibility applying a confirmation or
  disapproval of the meta-data which is then used to decide whether
  the source user's data is compatible for a merge or not.

- Why will people bother using it? Time is precious and this tool will
  take time from the user, to help them avoid wasting even more time
  scanning through resources which are hard to index/sort through
  relevance, and have like minded people's effort augment their own.

- Is there a way to lure power users to participate? It is known that
  the effort amongst users in a group follows a power law and there
  has to be incentive for those capable of putting in the time to do
  so; some direct feedback for their efforts. Keeping things simple
  that return of value is 'popularity' (a simple timeless
  currency). Tags which are supported, or useful, promote the creator.

- Can a new approach filter out unwanted content? This is probably the
  most essential as filtration is a basic principle. Yes it can by
  allowing negative sentiment to be directly accounted for both
  positive and negative edges to be produced.

- What about dashboards and overviews? There are many tools and
  features that can be introduced and maybe not a single approach is
  taken but they can still interact meaningfully if they follow the
  basic resource and meta-data paradigm.

How the promotion scheme works can become intricate and complicated
very easily. It can be kept simple by relying on the premise that any
activity which a user produces can be shared with other users that can
express their approval or disapproval.

Why not use the method of Marko Rodriguez, the famous graph database scientist
behind TitanDB and infamous Twitter user who also is a chicken farmer?
Yes, the method of <Rodriguez, M. A. (2009). A graph analysis of the linked data cloud. arXiv preprint arXiv:0903.0194.>
is very intresting but even in the abstract he says "integrating Resource Description Framework (RDF)data sets into a single unified representation"
and does not deviate from that premise. There is the effort to do this
'automatically' in <Rodriguez, M. A., Bollen, J., & Sompel, H. V. D. (2009). Automatic metadata generation using associative networks. ACM Transactions on Information Systems (TOIS), 27(2), 1-20.>
but all those automatic approaches always find barriers in the inability to appreciate rich media content. You may even bring up his work of
<Rodriguez, M. A. (2007, January). Social decision making with multi-relational networks and grammar-based particle swarms. In 2007 40th Annual Hawaii International Conference on System Sciences (HICSS'07) (pp. 39-39). IEEE.> where the relations propagate through the network; but it never actually involves the user in that propagation! The propagation without a user filtration for context means that errors can grow from the constant relevant signal of ontological information. There is also an approach by Mantzaris <Mantzaris, A. V., Walker, T. G., Taylor, C. E., & Ehling, D. (2019). Adaptive network diagram constructions for representing big data event streams on monitoring dashboards. Journal of Big Data, 6(1), 1-19.> which allows meta-data variables to associate through frequency of co-occurances, but even though that does allow for overlaps of ontological tags, and a natural growth of edge types for separations permitting even disjoint networks; its method of analysis is aimed at people being able to visualize the network topologies rather than incentive them to tag or to organize their accumulated resource set.

Once completed would this not fulfill the aspriration of Marvin Minsky to build a database of
common sense? Yes and no. He wanted a database for all common sense of people as a single map
which would mean that there would be so many exceptions for each rule/association that it would
not generalize well. People evolve and so does their view of common sense. The idea of relying upon
their incentive to perform the actions in an ad-hoc localized manner seems more plausible. 


*There are 2 other versions of this quote by Kalashnikov: "When a
young man, I read somewhere the following: God the Almighty said, 'All
that is too complex is unnecessary, and it is simple that is needed'"
and another version: “When a young man, I read somewhere the
following: God the Almighty said, 'All that is too complex is
unnecessary, and it is simple that is needed' ... So this has been my
lifetime motto – I have been creating weapons to defend the borders of
my fatherland, to be simple and reliable.”

From the book, "The Unfinished Revolution: How to Make Technology Work for Us--Instead of the Other Way Around", by the late Michael Dertouzos we can understand that his vision assumed individuals with local storage that would then choose to integrate their searches and data with others based upon the chosen demand.
